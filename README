The data used in this project was the Covid19 dataset downloaded from ourworldindata.org.
I loaded the the CSV file into Microsoft Excel just to take good look at the data and get familiar with it, after that; I imported the excel file into Microsoft sequel Server which I used for this project.
I used SQL to query the data inorder to gain insights such as;
- Global Vaccination Report By Countries 
- Percentage of the population Vaccinated by countries
- Global Case fatality by Countries
- Case fatality in my country Nigeria
- vaccination report in my country Nigeria 
And a few others, please do well to review the SQL file
