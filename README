The data used in this project was the Covid19 dataset downloaded from ourworldindata.org. Due to the large size of the file, I could'nt upload it here. I will attach a link to the page where the data can be easily downloaded.
Downlaod Page Link: https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-03-01..latest&facet=none&pickerSort=asc&pickerMetric=location&Metric=Confirmed+cases&Interval=7-day+rolling+average&Relative+to+Population=true&Color+by+test+positivity=false&country=USA~GBR~CAN~DEU~ITA~IND
I loaded the the CSV file into Microsoft Excel just to take good look at the data and get familiar with it, after that; I imported the excel file into Microsoft sequel Server which I used for this project.
I used SQL to query the data inorder to gain insights such as;
- Global Vaccination Report By Countries 
- Percentage of the population Vaccinated by countries
- Global Case fatality by Countries
- Case fatality in my country Nigeria
- vaccination report in my country Nigeria 
And a few others, please do well to review the SQL file
